Teaching at both the middle school and university levels afforded me great experience in leadership, collaboration and team building. Ultimately, I've decided to pursue software development to leverage my practical, creative and intellectual skills and interests. My love of learning and problem solving, along with my fascination with language and logic, have prepared me well for a career in a field that is always changing and expanding in new, exciting ways.</p>",

        "bio": "<p>The power of modern computers has always fascinated me. From the old desktops I used in elementary school, to the powerful handheld smart phones of today; computers truly are magical. I first experienced writing code while in the US Navy. While simple, the code my platoon wrote helped guide Unmanned Underwater Vehicles to locate mines in the ocean. The power of this technology had me asking questions and the Nashville Software School has been there to provide answers. I look forward to my career as a Software Developer.</p>",

        "bio": "Before software development I was a fisheries biologist managing small impoundments and recreational fish populations. My interest in being a developer started when I took an online course learning HTML and CSS. My favorite aspects about software development are the continuous learning, being able to build something from scratch, and tinker with something that already exists.",
